# Spotify-inspired interface

This project represents a significant step in my web development journey. I have successfully created a basic Spotify interface using only HTML and CSS, demonstrating a foundational understanding of web page structure and styling. While the interface currently lacks functionality, the process of building it from scratch has provided valuable insights into how web pages are constructed and styled.
